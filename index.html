<h1> About Me </h1> 

<h2>Academics</h2>
Hi there! I am a senior at Harvard University studying statistics and math. 
Most of my work revolves around machine learning, statisitics, 
data science, computational modelling and quantitiative analyses. Currently, I work majorly on statistics with a focus on data science 
and planning on doing research on theoretical machine learning on the side. 

I graduate from Harvard in May 2023.

<h2>Other activities</h2>

I am an aspiring data scientist and outside of class and research, I consult for start-ups via the Harvard Data Analytics Group. 
I am also a peer tutor for the Introduction to Calculus Course Series through the Academic Resource Center.

<!-- I am passionate about many things and this is a space I reserve to write about them - machine learning, statisitics, data science and quantitaitive finance.  -->

<!-- Aside from my academic involvements, I enjoy farming vegetables.  -->
